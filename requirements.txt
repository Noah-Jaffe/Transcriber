        # pip version of indic-numtowords is broken, need to manually install. required downstream of nemo-toolkit[asr]
        indic-numtowords @ git+https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indic-numtowords.git

        # nemo-toolkit # broken by default, install directly from specific branch on the repo
        # @todo in the future, when the 2.4.x branch moves to main, update the requirements.txt to use main instead (main is on 2.3.2 @ 2025-07-21)

        # Fixes for https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33552, https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/36228 
        # merged into https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/36632, but we still experience the issue. An alternative fix 
        # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33552#issuecomment-2880032963 states we should try v4.38.2 which appears to work for some cases
        # @todo - occasionally check back in to see if the issue persists in the latest version of transformers
        transformers==4.38.2
